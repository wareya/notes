# Distinctive Chord Progressions in Punk Rock and Metal

Punk rock and metal typically build sections around four- or eight-chord loops (and eight-chord loops are often four-chord loops with a minor tweak the second time around). These loops are essentially the emotional foundation for each section, and the interplay between the harmony, melody, and rhythm determines how tension is built and released, rather than the harmony being the strongest carrier. Deliberately breaking the loops up prematurely can be another way to carry tension.

What's more, the place the loop "starts" has an extremely big effect on the emotional quality of the progression; "I IV V iv" and "iv I IV V" behave completely differently. The voicing can also have an impact on the loop's character, even going as far as the particular octave each note is played at mattering; in particular, bringing the entire chord up or down an octave can have a huge impact on the loop's emotional profile, because of changing the stepwise motion between the roots.

All chord progressions here are written from the perspective of the major key. This is because rock music plays with modal ambiguity extensively; deciding on a modal center would be "unfair".

The distinction between modal harmony and functional harmony is ignored because rock music has an easy time slipping back and forth between the two (as seen by people not being weirded out when JRPGs have prog rock boss themes). (e.g. minor chord progressions resolve to vi; lydian chord progressions resolve to IV; etc)

One thing you might notice about these progressions is how infrequent ii and viio chords are. My theory is that this is because they're very far from vi/I on the "circle of thirds" (assuming you follow the thirds of the major/minor scale). A more practical set of reasons might be: ii makes chord progressions with vi feel a lot more "angry"/"depressed"; and vii (or the diminished/dominant sounds in general) is often used to *finalize* a four-chord loop when a section finishes, and having it as a structural part of the loop would pack too many instances of strong tension release into too little musical time.

## IV V vi (vi/I)

I comically refer to this as the "default emotional chord progression" as a reference to a video essay that analyzed music from Zun, and because of its frequency in metalcore/post-hardcore and gothic rock.

The precise quality of the fourth chord doesn't matter as long as it's not IV or V, though it's I by default with vi coming in second.

## IV V iii iv

Something about this chord progression yells "hey, it's like vi IV I V somehow, but... inside out? backwards? upside down?" to me, and thinking about it, it makes sense. It's also like "default emotional chord progression" but with a hesitation in the third slot, like it doesn't want to give you that powerful "vi" hit until it's done talking.

Hearts Grow - かさなる影 (Kasanaru Kage) (chorus)

## vi V IV (iii/III)

Ah, yes, the andalusian cadence, everyone's favorite "things are going wrong" or "bad people doing bad things" progression. As punk and metal music so often harmonize entirely with powerchords (or even single notes or octaves!), the quality of the iii/III chord basically doesn't matter.

## vi V IV V

This feels like a hybrid between the andalusian cadence and the "default emotional chord progression".

## vi IV I(above vi) V

This chord progression dislikes resolving. It just wants to keep going forever. Something about its emotional feel makes me want to call it the "highlander" progression even though there's no real association with the word.

The Misfits - Dig Up Her Bones (chorus)

## vi IV I(below vi) (V/iii)

This has an entirely distinct emotional profile from "vi IV I(above vi) V". Why? Beats me. Swapping out iii for V on the last chord here has relatively little impact on the emotional profile, but doing it to the "above" version results in a completely different emotional profile.

IRON ATTACK! - DIVINE WIND

## vi IV V (iii/III)

It's the andalusian cadence, but the middle two chords are flipped around, so it doesn't sound as evil! In fact, the iii/III can sound like a lower extension of the V. How would that work with III? Beats me. Maybe it makes the V retroactively sound like #vo?

Ariabl'Eyes - Romanesque Romancia (instrumental part of the chorus)

## vi IV V vi

It's the "default emotional chord progression", but with a twist! No ambiguity making you think it might resolve to the IV! How fun! Did anyone else notice how many loops start with "vi IV"?

## I V vi IV

Remember when I said that the place the loop starts has a huge impact on how the loop feels? Yeah. Welcome to what some people call the "most important" chord progression in the world.
