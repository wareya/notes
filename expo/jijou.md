## 事情がある

（誰かに・は）事情がある means that someone "has something going on", so to speak. This can mean various different things; maybe they have a nasty secret or a dark past, maybe they were abused as a child, maybe they just experienced an important milestone in character development or vowed to save someone's life or something. Lots of possibilities.

In a way, it's almost like 事情がある means that there's *complicating circumstances* behind someone's motivations, actions, interactions with other people, etc. Not just that they, like everyone else, *do indeed have* stuff going on, but rather that it's of particular noteworthiness for some reason or another.

This nuance extends to various similar phrases, and 事情 can be modified. For example, 何らかの事情を持っている has the same nuance.

But there's no intruige or deception of the sort that we were worried about. That is the conclusion that lay at the end of my investigation.*
